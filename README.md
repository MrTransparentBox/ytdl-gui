## First setup
	First time opening the program, you will be asked to give a directory. This will be the location which file will be downloaded to and scans will be taken from.

## Using the GUI
	Once the GUI is open you must enter one url on each line of the textbox in the GUI window.
	Then, once saved, you may click the download button.
	
## Customising options
	Under 'tools' you will find 'Download Options...'. When you click this a new menu pops up with different options for how and what should be downloaded.
	
## Customising preferences

## Choosing a font
